[Digital Future Society](https://digitalfuturesociety.com/) (DFS) invited face recognition companies, organisations and professionals to participate in a [hackathon challenge](https://digitalfuturesociety.com/data-challenge-sobre-derechos-digitales-y-privacidad/) consisting on adapting their products to the new Artificial Intelligence regulation proposal in the European Union ([AI Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623335154975&uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206)). They kindly invited me as a member of the jury, together with outstanding experts on data protection, digital regulation and AI. 

At the end of the day, participants proposed groundbreaking solutions to improve this biometric technology, with the aim of guaranteeing the security of people's privacy and trustworthy face recognition. Carme Artigas, the Secretary of State for Digitization and Artificial Intelligence of the Government of Spain, was in charge of giving the award to the winning companies, [Herta](https://hertasecurity.com/) and [Veridas](https://veridas.com/).
