I have been honoured to be selected by the Spanish Association of Women Researchers and Technologists ([AMIT](https://amit-es.org/)) to give the keynote speech at its [2023 General Assembly](https://amit-es.org/noticias/xxii-asamblea-general-de-amit/). We discussed AI and its risks and opportunities for gender equality.

Since 2002, AMIT has been defending the interests and equal rights and opportunities of Spanish women researchers and technologists. The General Assembly is its biggest annual event. This year, at its 22nd assembly, the aim was to open a debate on the need for AI with a gender perspective and data ethics. My keynote talk, entitled "Towards a fair and egalitarian Artificial Intelligence" was very much appreciated, and opened an interesting reflection on how to contemplate the gender perspective in emerging technologies from their beginnings.
