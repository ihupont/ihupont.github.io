I was happy to participate as a panelist in the [METAVERSE LEGALTECH TOMORROW](https://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:6933073112632578048/) webinar organised by the [Global LegalTech Hub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-legaltech-hub/).

We had excellent and interesting discussions around the future of the Metaverse, covering social, legal, economic and technological aspects. I tried to provide my own views on how AI and data -and their impact on humans- could potentially evolve in this new social paradigm that is yet to be discovered!
