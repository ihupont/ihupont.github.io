It was my pleasure to talk about neural networks and trustworthy AI at [SIE 2022](https://www.siehuesca.es/), a reference annual innovation and entrepreneurship fair in Spain. 

It was also a real honour to share the stage with my admired [María Blasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Blasco_Marhuenda). We talked about -both human and artificial- neural networks, in a beautiful tribute to the Aragonese neuroscientist [Santiago Ramón y Cajal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal), winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1906 for his original investigations of the microscopic structure of the brain.
