I presented [HUMAINT](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/communities/en/community/humaint)'s work on trustworthy AI as a part of the [cycle of conferences on innovation management](https://innovacion.unizar.es/charlas-abril) organised by the University of Zaragoza. 

Innovation and research are key for companies to equip themselves with differentiating elements to achieve competitive advantages. I presented the current challenges that must be overcome to achieve trustworthy AI systems, through the example of facial analysis applications. We discussed the emerging opportunities for creating highly innovative AI products that can be trusted by users and the general public.
