I participated in the panel on "Digital Solutions â€“ Real Impact: Leveraging Virtual Worlds for Global Change" in the context of the [UNITED NATIONS FIRST VIRTUAL WORLDS DAY](https://www.itu.int/metaverse/un-virtual-worlds-day/).

The first and pioneering [UN Virtual Worlds Day](https://www.itu.int/metaverse/un-virtual-worlds-day/) underscored the transformative impact of virtual worlds, including the metaverse and spatial computing, to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The session in which I participated delved into transformative real case studies where virtual worlds, the metaverse and spatial computing have been pivotal in addressing global challenges. Together with my co-panelists, we shared our insights on the immense opportunities these technologies present for sustainable development and societal impact, from combatting climate change to enhancing healthcare accessibility. Particularly, I addressed next-generation virtual worlds in the EU, noting how the EU strategy has analyzed and balanced the opportunities and challenges these technologies are likely to offer. I emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral perspective, covering technological, social, industrial, policy and economic dimensions, stressing that societal readiness is imperative, alongside technology monitoring and foresight.
