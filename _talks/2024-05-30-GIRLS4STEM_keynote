I had the honor of mentoring and delivering a keynote speech on Artificial Intelligence at the [5th EDITION OF GIRLS4STEM AWARDS](https://www.uv.es/girls4stem/InstrucSol2024.html).

The [Girls4STEM initiative](https://girls4stem.uv.es/#/principal) aims to inspire more students, especially girls, to pursue studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. This program encourages active participation from all stakeholders, including students, educators, professional associations and companies. The awards ceremony celebrated outstanding projects created by talented school students, showcasing and giving visibility to women in STEM. Through these projects, students presented innovative ideas and highlighted the significant contributions of women in these fields. It was an incredible experience to see the passion and creativity of these young minds. I am deeply committed to supporting initiatives like Girls4STEM that strive to close the gender gap in STEM and nurture the next generation of innovators. Let's continue to support and inspire our future leaders in STEM!
