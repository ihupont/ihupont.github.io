I presented the first year of the [DivinAI](https://ai-watch.ec.europa.eu/humaint/divinai_en) project at the AAAI-AIDBEI.

The [AAAI Workshop on Artificial Intelligence Diversity, Belonging, Equity, and Inclusion (AIDBEI)](https://kdd.cs.ksu.edu/Workshops/AAAI-2022/) is an event at the International Conference of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). This workshop is organized by Diverse In AI, an affinity group which aims to foster links between participants from underrepresented populations, which in artificial intelligence includes but is not limited to women, LGBTQ+ persons, and people of color. Diverse in AI was founded with the support and participation of Black in AI, WiML, LatinX in AI, Queer in AI, {Dis}Ability in AI, Indigenous in AI, and the Black in X Network.

I had the pleasure to present orally our paper entitled ["Monitoring Diversity of AI Conferences: Lessons Learnt and Future Challenges in the DivinAI Project"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01657.pdf). Its abstract follows:

<i>DivinAI is an open and collaborative initiative promoted by the European Commissionâ€™s Joint Research Centre in collaboration with Universitat Pompeu Fabra to measure and monitor diversity indicators related to AI conferences, with special focus on gender balance, geographical representation, and presence of academia vs companies. This paper summarizes the main achievements and lessons learnt during the first year of life of the DivinAI project, and proposes a set of recommendations for its further development and maintenance by the AI community.</i>
