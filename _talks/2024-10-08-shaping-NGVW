I was selected on behalf of a large multidisciplinary team of colleagues to present the results of our JRC report on [Next Generation Virtual Worlds](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC133757) in the [Shaping the Next Generation Virtual Worlds â€“ Science for Policy event](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/events/shaping-next-generation-virtual-worlds-2023-11-08_en). 

To dive deeper into the EU's strategic approach to immersive technologies, the JRC organised this event gathering experts and policymakers to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange to navigate the socio-economic and technological landscapes of virtual worlds. Key discussions addressed the role of research in policy, the socio-economic implications of virtual worlds, and the EU's actions to support new business models and applications in virtual environments.
