Honoured to participate in the roundtable on [AI AND DEMOCRACY](https://sciencefordemocracy.org/a-human-rights-centered-ai-design-hybrid-event-21st-september-the-hauge/) organised by [Science for Democracy](https://sciencefordemocracy.org/).

We reflected on the key steps towards trustworthy AI, most prominent challenges, and the need to assess and balance risks vs opportunites when moving AI systems to operational scenarios.
