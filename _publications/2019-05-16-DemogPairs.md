excerpt: "In this paper we present <b>DemogPairs</b>, a publicly released validation dataset with 10.8K facial images and 58.3M identity verification pairs, distributed in demographically-balanced folds of Asian, Black and White females and males. DemogPairs and its associated <b>benchmarking protocol</b> are conceived to explore demographic biases and the cross-demographic behaviour of face recognition algorithms.

Although deep face recognition has achieved impressive results in recent years, there is increasing controversy regarding racial and gender bias of the models, questioning their trustworthiness and deployment into sensitive scenarios. In this work we present <b>DemogPairs</b>, a new validation set with 10.8K facial images and 58.3M identity verification pairs, distributed in demographically-balanced folds of Asian, Black and White females and males. We also propose a <b>benchmark of experiments</b> using DemogPairs over state-of-the-art deep face recognition models in order to analyze their cross-demographic behavior and potential demographic biases (see figure below).
