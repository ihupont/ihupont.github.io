Hi! I'm Isabelle, a passionate researcher and expert in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) and Science4Policy (S4P), with almost 20 years of experience spanning academia, research institutes, industry and public policy. Since earning my [PhD](https://www.academia.edu/5104979/Affective_computing_Emotional_facial_sensing_and_multimodal_fusion_PhD_dissertation_I_Hupont) in 2010 from the University of Zaragoza, Spain, where I focused on affective computing and facial expression analysis for enhancing interactions with virtual agents, I have been dedicated to advancing the frontiers of AI and its real-world applications.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working across diverse institutions, including academic settings ([Affective Lab](http://giga.cps.unizar.es/affectivelab/) – University of Zaragoza; Sorbonne University, Paris), technological institutes ([Aragon Institute of Technology](https://www.ita.es/), Zaragoza; CNRS's [Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/), France) and the private sector ([Herta](https://hertasecurity.com/)). These experiences have given me a comprehensive understanding of the AI field, from foundational research to the delivery of market-ready products.

I joined the [Joint Research Centre of the European Commission](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en) in 2021. Since then, I have been exploring the policy side of science and technology, focusing on fostering trustworthy AI and next-generation digital ecosystems. In 2025, I continued this path by joining the [Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities](https://www.ciencia.gob.es/) as a Scientific Advisor to the Minister, where I contribute to shaping national science and innovation policies.

I have authored over [100 scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jNLffNcAAAAJ&hl=es) in high-impact journals and leading international conferences and have participated in more than 35 public-funded projects (national and European), taking on roles ranging from development to project management. Many of these projects have successfully bridged cutting-edge research and industrial innovation, resulting in transformative real-world applications.

Beyond my professional work, I'm deeply committed to [promoting diversity in STEM fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSWYDxxfyuM), particularly encouraging girls to pursue careers in technology. Since 2005, I have been an active member of [AMIT](https://amit-es.org/), Spanish leading association for women researchers and technologists. I firmly believe that fostering equal opportunities drives progress in science, technology and society.

As a proud Ambassador for Zaragoza, my hometown, I strive to share its talent and creativity with the world. When I'm not working, you might find me visiting schools to inspire the next generation of scientists, playing drums, watching a great TV series, or spending time with my adorable puppy Baba.
