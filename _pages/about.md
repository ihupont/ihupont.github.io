Hi there! My name is Isabelle and I am a passionate researcher on Artificial Intelligence (AI) with 15 years of experience in the field. Since 2010, I hold a PhD diploma from the University of Zaragoza, Spain. Mi thesis focused on affective computing, more particularly on facial expression analysis for the enhancement of human-machine interaction. 

Throughout my carreer, I have worked at different institutions of very different nature: purely academic (University of Zaragoza; Sorbonne University, Paris), technological institutes (Aragon Institute of Technology, Zaragoza; Institut des Syst√®mes Intelligents et de Robotique CNRS, France), and private sector (Herta). My research has always keep focusing on AI, affective computing, facial analysis, face recognition and human-machine (-robot, -computer) interaction. I find these facets of AI particularly attractive, as they require an inter/multidisciplinary approach involving very different players, such as computer scientists, robotics engineers, security bodies, psychologists, neuroscientists and humanists. I am currently a scientific project officer at the European Commission's Joint Research centre, exploring the policy side of AI and contributing to establish the path towards trustworthy AI in the European Union. 

My research has led to more than 60 scientific publications in highly-ranked journals and well-known international conferences. I have a track record participation in National (French and Spanish) and European (H2020, Interreg, Echord++, Eureka, AAL and SME Instument) public-funded projects. I have been part of more than 30 of them, under different roles, from junior (development tasks) to senior (project manager). A significant number of these projects have resulted in the technological transfer of cutting-edge R&D results to real and highly innovative SMEs products.

I am very committed to women's rights and a strong advocate for the need of diversity in AI. I believe that ensuring the defence of the interests and equal opportunities for all is an agent of change for society.

When not working on AI, I am likely playing drums, watching TV series or spending some time with my lovely kitten Ada.
