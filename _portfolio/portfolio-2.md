title: "A Forest"
excerpt: "I was lucky enough to collaborate with the wonderful artist [Max de Esteban](https://maxdeesteban.com/) on his brilliant work entitled [A Forest](https://www.klompching.com/newsblog/2021/2/2/max-de-esteban-museum-acquisition), which is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona ([MACBA](https://www.macba.cat/en)). In the piece of art below, the artist politely asks a deep neural network for a selfie, even though -as an algorithm- it has no self. Would [explainable AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) help to bridge this gap between machines and human beings? <br/><img src='/images/MACBA_Forest.jpg'>"
