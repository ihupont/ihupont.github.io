title: "Synocene – beyond the Anthropocene"
excerpt: "I feel extremely honoured to be the scientific side of the SciArt project [SYNOCENE](https://science-art-society.ec.europa.eu/naturarchy-projects#synocene--beyond-the-anthropocene) conceived by outstanding artists [Marina Wainer](https://marinaestelawainer.com/index.php/en/) and [Sam Nester](https://samnester.com/), and also in collaboration with my colleague [Lucía Iglesias](https://science-art-society.ec.europa.eu/researchers-policymakers#luc%C3%ADa-iglesias-blanco) from European Commission's DG Environment. SYNOCENE is a 360 degree involving sound installation where the voices of humans, artificial intelligence and nature co-exist exploring a decentered view of our anthropocentric experience of the natural world. <br> <br/><img src='/images/synocene.PNG'>"
